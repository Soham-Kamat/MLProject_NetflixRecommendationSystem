Group-
Harshita Mishra D12C 40
Soham Kamat D12C 28

Algorithms used-

We have used Collaborative filtering where it relies on past user and item dataset
We have used-
1.Singular Value Decomposition
2.Pearson R Correlation

The datasets used are-
1.dataset.txt
2.movies_titles.csv

dataset.txt  is of the following format-
1:
678,3,2000-5-12
554657,2,2003-6-13
2:
678,3,200-5-12
â€¦.and so on

This means Movie_id 1 has been watched by Cust_id 678 and the customer has given rating 3 on 2000-5-12,similarly for others.

Movies_titles.csv contains the list of movies along with their ids
Movie_Id   Name
1            Jurassic Park
2        Jurassic Park 2
...and soon
